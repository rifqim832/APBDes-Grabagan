DONE:
- Removed the stuck "039" (it was hardcoded).
- Now the "Nomor Surat Keluar" uses the Auto-Increment value (001...) from the database.
- It is now an **Input Field** in the preview, so you can manually change it (e.g. to 005) if needed.
- Format: `900 / [001] / 414.420 / 2026`.

ACTION:
1. Refresh Browser.
2. The number should start at 001.
3. You can click on "001" to edit it.
