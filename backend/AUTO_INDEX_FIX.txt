DONE:
- Updated `parsingController.js` to use an Auto-Increment Counter.
- If the 'No' column in Excel is empty or invalid, the backend now automatically assigns 1, 2, 3...
- This ensures the table always has a valid number sequence.

ACTION:
1. Since we modified the backend logic, **restart the backend server**:
   - Ctrl+C in the backend terminal.
   - Run `node server.js` again.
2. Upload your Excel file again.
3. Check the Preview table; the "No" column should now be populated correctly.
