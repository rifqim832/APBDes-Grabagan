DONE:
- Configured the system to **Print ONLY the Letter**.
- When you click "Cetak Dokumen", the browser's print dialog will open showing ONLY the clean A4 letter, hiding all buttons, sidebars, and menus.
- Added support for background colors (like the helper row shading) to be preserved in print.

ACTION:
1. Refresh Browser.
2. Go to the final step.
3. Click "Cetak Dokumen".
4. Check the print preview -> It should show a perfect A4 letter.
