DONE:
- Removed the hardcoded "900/039/..." logic that was overriding your numbers.
- Integrated the Auto-Increment Number ("001") into the correct visualization format.
- Now:
  - "Nomor Surat Keluar" will be: `900/{AutoNum}/414.420/2026` (e.g., 900/001/414.420/2026).
  - "Nomor Surat Masuk" will be: `900/{ExcelNum}/.../2026` (e.g., 900/039/...).

ACTION:
1. Refresh the Frontend.
2. Upload file.
3. Check the preview. It should now show "001" (or next number) correctly.
