DONE:
- Implemented "Header Mapping" logic.
- System SCANS for 'No', 'SPM', 'Kegiatan', 'Anggaran' in ANY column.
- Automatically handles MERGED cells (like E-F).
- Automatically handles FORMULAS in Anggaran.

ACTION:
1. Restart Backend (node server.js).
2. Upload ANY Excel file (as long as it has those headers).
3. Check backend log: "Header found at Row X: { no: 2, spm: 4, ... }"
