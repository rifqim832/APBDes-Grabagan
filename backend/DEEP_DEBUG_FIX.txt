DONE:
- Added advanced debugging logic to `handleDownloadDocx`.
- The code now checks if the server returned HTML (Page Not Found) or if the file signature is invalid (Corrupted).
- This will prevent the confusing "Can't find end of central directory" PizZip error and show a real reason instead.

ACTION:
1. Hard Refresh (Ctrl+F5).
2. Click "Download DOCX".
3. If it fails, read the specific error message shown in the popup. It will guide us to the exact problem.
