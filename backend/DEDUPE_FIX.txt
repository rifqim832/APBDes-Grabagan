DONE:
- Fixed the duplication issue ("Tunjangan... Tunjangan... Tunjangan...").
- The parser now checks if a cell is merged.
- If merged (e.g., E-G), it only reads data from the **Master Cell (E)** and ignores the clones in F and G.
- Scan Area logic remains intact, so it still works for scattered or single-cell data (rows 14, 25, 26).

ACTION:
1. **Restart Backend** (Ctrl+C -> `node server.js`).
2. Refresh Frontend.
3. Upload "REKOM DERMAWU.xlsx" once more.
4. Verify that:
   - "Kegiatan" text is complete.
   - There are NO duplicate phrases.
