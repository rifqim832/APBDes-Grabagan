DONE:
- Added `get-last-number` endpoint to backend.
- Updated Frontend to fetch the last letter number on load.
- "Nomor Surat Keluar" will now auto-increment (001, 002, 003...) based on the database content.

ACTION:
1. **Restart the backend server** (Ctrl+C, then `node server.js`).
   (This is required because I added a new API route).
2. Refresh the frontend.
3. The number field should now show the next available number automatically!
