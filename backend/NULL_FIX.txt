DONE:
- Fixed a backend error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'result')`.
- This happened because an empty cell was being treated as an object (Excel behavior) but was actually null.

ACTION:
1. **Restart the backend server** (Ctrl+C, then `node server.js`).
2. Upload your file again. It should parse correctly now.
