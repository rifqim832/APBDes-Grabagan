FIX APPLIED:
The backend parsing logic has been updated to match your Excel template.
- Starts reading at Row 18.
- Reads 'Kegiatan' from Column E.
- Reads 'Anggaran' from Column H.
- Handles '6.000.000' format correctly.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Restart the backend server (Ctrl+C, then 'node server.js').
2. Try uploading the file again.
