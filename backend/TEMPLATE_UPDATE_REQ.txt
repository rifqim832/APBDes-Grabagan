DONE:
- Updated the system to calculate the **Total Budget** automatically.
- Formatted all numbers (e.g. `5000000` -> `5.000.000`) for professional output in Word.
- Prepared the variable `{total_anggaran}` for the Word template.

CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED (MANUAL):
You need to update your `template.docx` file manually because I cannot edit Word files directly.

1. Open `public/assets/template.docx`.
2. Scroll to the table.
3. Add a **New Row** at the bottom of the table (outside the loop).
4. In the "Kegiatan" column of that new row, type: **JUMLAH TOTAL** (Make it Bold).
5. In the "Anggaran" column of that new row, type: **{total_anggaran}** (Make it Bold).
6. Save the file.

Once done, refresh the website and try downloading again. It will now show the perfectly summed total.
