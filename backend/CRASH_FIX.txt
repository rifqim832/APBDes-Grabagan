DONE:
- Fixed the "sequenceNum is not defined" crash.
- This happened because I renamed `sequenceNum` to `incomingLetterNo` but forgot to update the input field in Step 1 (Info Header).

ACTION:
1. Refresh Browser.
2. The page should load correctly now.
3. Step 1 (Info Header) now correctly asks for "No. Surat Permohonan" (which will be `incomingLetterNo`).
4. Step 5 (Finished) will show the Auto-Incremented "Nomor Surat Keluar".
